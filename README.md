# Project Discontinued
I showed this to them and they didn't even bother try it.
And a year later they shut down the website. Trash tier startup gone backrupt probably.

# ProbotOnline
Gone. It was an insanely bad website and their concept was users can code their Texas Holdem bot to compete with each other. And they don't even provide a host and they tell users to setup their own heroku instance because their server calls REST method from the USER SERVER. Like do they not even know socket.io? My college is full of clowns istg. 
* ~~Gateway/online site for https://probotplayground.com bot~~
* ~~Website: https://probot.yuu.studio~~

## Demo
Gone.
~~Really bad quality and can't see anything, just check out the site.~~
